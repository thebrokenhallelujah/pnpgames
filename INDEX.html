Right now I only have one thing here: "backpack" cards for the game Parks. I got the idea from Century: Spice Road. There are five different cards, and one has a green triangle on the bottom right to represent the first player token. At the beginning of the game, take one card for each player, including the one with the first player mark. Shuffle and distribute them upside down. Whoever has the first player backpack card also gets the first player token. During the game, each player keeps their resources on the icon squares. If a player has more resource tokens than fit on the card, they must discard down to 12 at the end of their turn.

All images used are public domain. The icons from the National Park Service came from Wikimedia Commons, and the background landscapes came from Creative Commons. The parks featured are: Theodore Roosevelt National Park (the first player card), Arches National Park, Glacier National Park, Canyonland National Park, and Badlands National Park.
